    <h1>Our Knowledge </h1>

                <h3>Smart Working</h3>
                <p>Smart technologies will continue to have a significant impact on organizations, forcing “leaders” to change their mind-set and behaviour.
It will be more and more accepted that in order to be agile, lean and innovative, organizations need to become “flatter”, purpose-driven and network-based.</p>

                <p>The Internet of Things will become more and more a reality. For instance, 2018 is predicted to be a landmark year for autonomous cars, as regulators increasingly start to permit hands-off driving on the motorway.</p>

                <p>Courses will be more and more offered online. The focus will be on the knowledge and understanding of smart technologies.
But there is more. The expectations of the next generation are clear. The digital generation belong to a culture that has no memory of a pre-Internet age. They have become immersed in a culture of smart technologies and all its relatively “effortless” possibilities.</p>

Functional Design has become Bailey's passion (off the water) and is the fire that drives OPS to create the best eco-conscious active swimwear that continues to be loved by Water Women in more than 10 countries.</p>
